      <p align="justify">Perfect your skin. When it comes to makeup, keep in mind that "less is more." "Many women make the mistake of trying to cover up fine lines with layers of makeup; in effect, this actually makes them look older," notes New York City makeup ace Mel Rau. Instead, look for a new breed of skin-perfecting products with photo-optic technology, which brightens, resurfaces and improves your skin's clarity. One favorite: Estee Lauder Prime FX Color Neutralizing Primer ($25; esteelauder.com).

Choose professional eyebrow shaping. A skilled eyebrow shaping can totally transform your face. (Prices range from about $30-$60; call your local salon.) "The entire eye area can appear 'lifted' and more open, helping women look younger and much more polished," explains New York City-based celebrity makeup artist Ramy Gafni. Maintenance simply involves "cleaning up" brows underneath and removing only the strays on top.

Since eyebrow coloring at home can easily go wrong (you don't want to take any chances working that close to your eyes), experiment with makeup pencils and powders.

Not every makeup artist is prepared to make-over your mother- or grandmother-in-law. If a member of your bridal party or one of the family has mature skin, make sure to ask your potential makeup artist if they’re prepared to accommodate that person.
